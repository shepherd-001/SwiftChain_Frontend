 * - Reads shipment from the backend via React Query.
 * - Exposes `canCancel` so the component never re-implements the rule.
 * - Mutates with `shipmentService.cancelShipment` and invalidates the
 *   shipment cache on success so any consumer re-fetches fresh state.
 * - Surfaces UX feedback through Sonner toasts, with an explicit
